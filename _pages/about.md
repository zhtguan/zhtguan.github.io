I'm Tony, an undergraduate student at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), currently a visiting student in the [Soft and Micro Robotics Laboratory](https://smrl.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://mit.edu/).

My research focuses on developing advanced, robust robotic systems that combine sensors, estimates, mechatronics, and model-based/data-driven control/optimization theory. My passion extends beyond the construction and control of robots, as it also involves the creation and utilisation of specialised structures and sensors for control, as well as the direction of design and sensing from control theory, ultimately leading to the development of more interesting, intelligent, and powerful robots.

**I am seeking PhD opportunities in Robotics in Fall 2025.**
