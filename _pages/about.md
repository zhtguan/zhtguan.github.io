Hi, I'm Tony, a first-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT, advised by [Prof. Kevin Chen](https://smrl.mit.edu/). I received (with honors) my bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronic Information Engineering from ShanghaiTech University, advised by Prof. [Yu Liu](https://pspal.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), [Weibang Bai](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/baiwb_en/main.htm), and [Jiahao Chen](https://horychen.github.io/mmlabSite2/).

I am interested in developing an execution and decision-making system for micro robots that can achieve athletic abilities, robustness, and intelligence in the real world through the conjunction of perception, control, and mechatronic design.
