I'm Tony, an undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University, working with Prof. [Yu Liu](https://pspal.shanghaitech.edu.cn/), [Weibang Bai](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/baiwb_en/main.htm), and [Jiahao Chen](https://horychen.github.io/mmlabSite2/). Currently, I am an undergraduate visiting student in the [Soft and Micro Robotics Laboratory](https://smrl.mit.edu/) at MIT supervised by Prof. Kevin Chen.

I am interested in developing execution and decision making system that can achieve athletic abilities, robustness, and intelligence in the real world through the conjunction of perception, control and mechatronic design. I've worked with bipedal and sub-gram flapping-wing robots. Please read my CV and publication for more information.

**I am seeking PhD opportunities in Robotics in Fall 2025.**
